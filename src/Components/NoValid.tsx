        The child had looked so excited when the clown had presented a large red
        balloon.
        <br /> You had seen this, but in the throes of your morning commute you
        didn’t register it until it was too late.
        <br /> Who asked the government to support a fair right through Main
        Street during a week day anyway?
        <br />
        Your bike barrelled right between the child and the clown and sent the
        balloon on its merry way.
        <br /> You didn’t turn back to see the damage you had done. Later you
        saw the balloon floating outside your office window.
